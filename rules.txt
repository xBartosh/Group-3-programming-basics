Rules for BattleShip

Game Objective

The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships. 
All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board(it is a bot in our game). 
You try and hit them by typing the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  
The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates(bot does that automatically). 
Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.  
Each board has two grids: the upper section for the player's ships and the lower part for recording the player's 
guesses.

Starting a New Game

Each player places the 10 ships somewhere on their board. The ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally. 
Diagonal placement is not allowed. No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the board.  
Ships may not overlap each other. No ships may be placed on another ship. 

Once the guessing begins, the players may not move the ships.

The 10 ships are:  1x Battleship (4), 2x Cruiser (3),  3x Destroyer (2), 4x Boat (1).  

Playing the Game

Player's take turns guessing by typing the coordinates. You can see if you missed or hit enemy's ship on the screen. 
The board is marked with characters: S for hit, * for miss. 
For example, if you call out F6 and your opponent does not have any ship located at F6, the character will be *.  
Your miss on F6 is marked by *.

When all of the squares that one your ships occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk. It will be announced by 
"x element ship sunk".  

As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, the game ends.
